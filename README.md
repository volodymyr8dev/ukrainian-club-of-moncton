## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

After cloning and installing all the dependencies with either <code>yarn</code>, <code>npm</code>, etc., run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

And also create a `.env` file similar to `.env.example` and include the appropriate keys.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
