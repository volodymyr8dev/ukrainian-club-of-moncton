              We are an independent, non-profit, self-sufficient club founded and 
              chartered in 1975. Our membership consists of people of all ages and 
              walks of life.

            Our focus from 1975 on has always been to preserve and promote 
            Ukrainian culture by educating ourselves and the public. We have done
            this in many ways - presentations, Pysanky workshops, book donations
            to libraries and inviting the media to cover our feasts, as well as 
            our exhibitions in the Moncton City Library and the Moncton Museum. 
            We have been delighted in recent years to welcome as members emigr√©s
            from Ukraine with their eagerness to participate in our activities, 
            and their indomitable enthusiasm.
            <br />

              Finally, we welcome new members who are willing to promote Ukrainian
              culture.
